/**
 * Defines a projection of sphere cells to the cube-space.
 *
 * This interface defines various constants that describe the shapes and sizes of S2Cells.
 * They are useful for deciding which cell level to use in order to satisfy a given condition (e.g. that cell vertices
 * must be no further than "x" apart).  All of the raw constants are differential quantities; you can use the
 * getValue(level) method to compute the corresponding length or area on the unit sphere for cells at a given level.
 * The minimum and maximum bounds are valid for cells at all levels, but they may be somewhat conservative for very
 * large cells (e.g. face cells).
 *
 * Three different projections from cell-space (s,t) to cube-space (u,v) are implemented: linear, quadratic, and
 * tangent. They have the following tradeoffs:
 *
 *  Linear - This is the fastest transformation, but also produces the least
 *    uniform cell sizes.  Cell areas vary by a factor of about 5.2, with the
 *    largest cells at the center of each face and the smallest cells in
 *    the corners.
 *
 *  Tangent - Transforming the coordinates via atan() makes the cell sizes
 *    more uniform.  The areas vary by a maximum ratio of 1.4 as opposed to a
 *    maximum ratio of 5.2.  However, each call to atan() is about as expensive
 *    as all of the other calculations combined when converting from points to
 *    cell ids, i.e. it reduces performance by a factor of 3.
 *
 *  Quadratic - This is an approximation of the tangent projection that
 *    is much faster and produces cells that are almost as uniform in size.
 *    It is about 3 times faster than the tangent projection for converting
 *    cell ids to points or vice versa.  Cell areas vary by a maximum ratio of
 *    about 2.1.
 *
 * Here is a table comparing the cell uniformity using each projection.  "Area ratio" is the maximum ratio over all
 * subdivision levels of the largest cell area to the smallest cell area at that level, "edge ratio" is the maximum
 * ratio of the longest edge of any cell to the shortest edge of any cell at the same level, and "diag ratio" is the
 * ratio of the longest diagonal of any cell to the shortest diagonal of any cell at the same level. "ToPoint" and
 * "FromPoint" are the times in microseconds required to convert cell ids to and from points (unit vectors)
 * respectively.  "ToPointRaw" is the time to convert to a non-unit-length vector, which is all that is needed for
 * some purposes.
 *
 *  Area    Edge    Diag   ToPointRaw  ToPoint  FromPoint
 *  Ratio   Ratio   Ratio             (microseconds)
 *  -------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Linear:      5.200   2.117   2.959      0.020     0.087     0.085
 *  Tangent:     1.414   1.414   1.704      0.237     0.299     0.258
 *  Quadratic:   2.082   1.802   1.932      0.033     0.096     0.108
 *
 * The worst-case cell aspect ratios are about the same with all three projections. The maximum ratio of the longest
 * edge to the shortest edge within the same cell is about 1.4 and the maximum ratio of the diagonals within the same
 * cell is about 1.7.
 *
 * This data was produced using s2cell_test and s2cell_id_test.
 *
 * This class is a port of s2coords and s2metrics of the Google S2 Geometry project
 * (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).

     * Cell min width

     * The width of geometric figure is defined as the distance between two parallel bounding lines in a given
     * direction.  For cells, the minimum width is always attained between two opposite edges, and the maximum width is
     * attained between two opposite vertices.  However, for our purposes we redefine the width of a cell as the
     * perpendicular distance between a pair of opposite edges.  A cell therefore has two widths, one in each direction.
     * The minimum width according to this definition agrees with the classic geometric one, but the maximum width is
     * different.  (The maximum geometric width corresponds to kMaxDiag defined below.)
     *
     * For a cell at level k, the distance between opposite edges is at least kMinWidth.getValue(k) and at most
     * kMaxWidth.getValue(k). The average width in both directions for all cells at level k is approximately
     * kAvgWidth.getValue(k).
     *
     * The width is useful for bounding the minimum or maximum distance from a point on one edge of a cell to the
     * closest point on the opposite edge. For example, this is useful when "growing" regions by a fixed distance.
     *
     * Note that because S2Cells are not usually rectangles, the minimum width of a cell is generally smaller than its
     * minimum edge length.  (The interior angles of an S2Cell range from 60 to 120 degrees.)

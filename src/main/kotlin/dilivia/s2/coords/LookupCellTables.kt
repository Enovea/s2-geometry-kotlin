/**
 * The following lookup tables are used to convert efficiently between an
 * (i,j) cell index and the corresponding position along the Hilbert curve.
 * "lookup_pos" maps 4 bits of "i", 4 bits of "j", and 2 bits representing the
 * orientation of the current cell into 8 bits representing the order in which
 * that subcell is visited by the Hilbert curve, plus 2 bits indicating the
 * new orientation of the Hilbert curve within that subcell. (Cell
 * orientations are represented as combination of kSwapMask and kInvertMask.)
 *
 * "lookup_ij" is an inverted table used for mapping in the opposite
 * direction.
 *
 * We also experimented with looking up 16 bits at a time (14 bits of position
 * plus 2 of orientation) but found that smaller lookup tables gave better
 * performance. (2KB fits easily in the primary cache.)
 * Values for these constants are *declared* in the *.h file. Even though
 * the declaration specifies a value for the constant, that declaration
 * is not a *definition* of storage for the value. Because the values are
 * supplied in the declaration, we don't need the values here. Failing to
 * define storage causes link errors for any code that tries to take the
 * address of one of these values.

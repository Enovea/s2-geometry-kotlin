/**
 * This class allows edges to be efficiently tested for intersection with a given fixed edge AB.
 * It is especially efficient when testing for intersection with an edge chain connecting vertices v0, v1, v2, ...
 *
 * Example usages:
 *
 *   fun countIntersections(a: S2Point, b: S2Point, edges: List<Pair<S2Point, S2Point>>) {
 *     val count: Int = 0
 *     val crosser = S2EdgeCrosser(a, b)
 *     for (edge : edges) {
 *       if (crosser.crossingSign(edge.first, edge.second) >= 0) {
 *         ++count
 *       }
 *     }
 *     return count
 *   }
 *
 * This class, store last edge of tested point in order to compute tangents twince when processing a chain. So, it is
 * also possible to do:
 *
 *   val chain: List<S2Point>
 *   crosser.restartAt(chain[0])
 *   for (i in 1..chain.lastIndex) {
 *     if (crosser.edgeOrVertexCrossing(chain[i])) { ++count }
 *   }
 *
 * This class is a port of the S2EdgeCrosser class of the Google S2 Geometry project (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).
 *
 * @constructor Default constructor. must be followed by a call to init().

     * This function determines whether the edge AB intersects the edge CD.
     *
     * Note that if an edge is degenerate (A == B or C == D), the return value is 0, if two vertices from different
     * edges are the same and -1 otherwise.
     *
     * Properties of crossingSign:
     *
     * (1) crossingSign(b,a,c,d) == crossingSign(a,b,c,d)
     * (2) crossingSign(c,d,a,b) == crossingSign(a,b,c,d)
     * (3) CrossingSign(a,b,c,d) == 0 if a==c, a==d, b==c, b==d
     * (3) CrossingSign(a,b,c,d) <= 0 if a==b or c==d (see above)
     *
     * This function implements an exact, consistent perturbation model such that no three points are ever considered to
     * be collinear. This means that even if you have 4 points A, B, C, D that lie exactly in a line
     * (say, around the equator), C and D will be treated as being slightly to one side or the other of AB.
     * This is done in a way such that the results are always consistent (see S2Predicates.sign).
     *
     * Note that if you want to check an edge against a chain of other edges, it is slightly more efficient to use the
     * single-argument version of crossingSign below.

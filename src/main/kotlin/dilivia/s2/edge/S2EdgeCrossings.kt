     * Given two edges AB and CD where at least two vertices are identical (i.e. crossingSign(a,b,c,d) == 0), this
     * function defines whether the two edges "cross" in a such a way that point-in-polygon containment tests can be
     * implemented by counting the number of edge crossings.  The basic rule is that a "crossing" occurs if AB is
     * encountered after CD during a CCW sweep around the shared vertex starting from a fixed reference point.
     *
     * Note that according to this rule, if AB crosses CD then in general CD does not cross AB. However, this leads to
     * the correct result when counting polygon edge crossings.  For example, suppose that A,B,C are three consecutive
     * vertices of a CCW polygon.  If we now consider the edge crossings of a segment BP as P sweeps around B, the
     * crossing number changes parity exactly when BP crosses BA or BC.

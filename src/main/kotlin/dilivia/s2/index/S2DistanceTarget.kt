// S2DistanceTarget represents a geometric object to which distances are
// measured.  For example, there are subtypes for measuring distances to a
// point, an edge, or to an S2ShapeIndex (an arbitrary collection of
// geometry).  S2DistanceTarget objects are provided for the benefit of
// classes that measure distances and/or find nearby geometry, such as
// S2ClosestEdgeQuery, S2ClosestPointQuery, and S2ClosestCellQuery.
//
// Implementations do *not* need to be thread-safe.  They may cache data or
// allocate temporary data structures in order to improve performance.  For
// this reason, S2DistanceTarget objects are typically passed as pointers
// rather than as const references.
//
// The Distance template argument is used to represent distances.  Usually
// this type is a thin wrapper around S1ChordAngle, but another distance type
// may be substituted as long as it implements the API below.  This can be
// used to change the comparison function (e.g., to find the furthest edges
// from the target), to get more accuracy, or to measure non-spheroidal
// distances (e.g., using the WGS84 ellipsoid).
//
// The Distance concept is as follows:
//
// class Distance {
//  public:
//   // Default and copy constructors, assignment operator:
//   Distance();
//   Distance(const Distance&);
//   Distance& operator=(const Distance&);
//
//   // Factory methods:
//   static Distance Zero();      // Returns a zero distance.
//   static Distance Infinity();  // Larger than any valid distance.
//   static Distance Negative();  // Smaller than any valid distance.
//
//   // Comparison operators:
//   friend bool operator==(Distance x, Distance y);
//   friend bool operator<(Distance x, Distance y);
//
//   // Delta represents the positive difference between two distances.
//   // It is used together with operator-() to implement Options::max_error().
//   // Typically Distance::Delta is simply S1ChordAngle.
//   class Delta {
//    public:
//     Delta();
//     Delta(const Delta&);
//     Delta& operator=(const Delta&);
//     friend bool operator==(Delta x, Delta y);
//     static Delta Zero();
//   };
//
//   // Subtraction operator.  Note that the second argument represents a
//   // delta between two distances.  This distinction is important for
//   // classes that compute maximum distances (e.g., S2FurthestEdgeQuery).
//   friend Distance operator-(Distance x, Delta delta);
//
//   // Method that returns an upper bound on the S1ChordAngle corresponding
//   // to this Distance (needed to implement Options::max_distance
//   // efficiently).  For example, if Distance measures WGS84 ellipsoid
//   // distance then the corresponding angle needs to be 0.56% larger.
//   S1ChordAngle GetChordAngleBound() const;
// };

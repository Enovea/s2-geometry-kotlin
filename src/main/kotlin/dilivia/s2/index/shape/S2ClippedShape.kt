 * S2ClippedShape represents the part of a shape that intersects an S2Cell. It consists of the set of edge ids that

 * Note that the edges themselves are not clipped; we always use the original edges for intersection tests so that the
 * results will be the same as the original shape.
 *
 * @property shapeId The shape id of the clipped shape.
 * @property edges The ids of the edges that intersects the cell.
 * @property containsCenter Indicates if the center of the cell is inside the shape (for shape that have an interior).

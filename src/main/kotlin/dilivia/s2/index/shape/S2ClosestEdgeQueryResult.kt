 * Each "Result" object represents a closest edge. Note the following special cases:

 *  - (shapeId >= 0) && (edgeId < 0) represents the interior of a shape.
 *    Such results may be returned when options.includeInteriors is true.
 *    Such results can be identified using the isInterior() method.
 *
 *  - (shapeId < 0) && (edgeId < 0) is returned by `findClosestEdge`  to indicate that no edge satisfies the given query

/**
 * MutableS2ShapeIndex is a class for in-memory indexing of polygonal geometry. The objects in the index are known as
 * "shapes", and may consist of points, polylines, and/or polygons, possibly overlapping. The index makes it very
 * fast to answer queries such as finding nearby shapes, measuring distances, testing for intersection and
 * containment, etc.
 *
 * Internally, MutableS2ShapeIndex is essentially a map from S2CellIds to the set of shapes that intersect each
 * S2CellId.  It is adaptively refined to ensure that no cell contains more than a small number of edges.
 *
 * For efficiency, updates are batched together and applied lazily on the first subsequent query. Locking is used to
 * ensure that MutableS2ShapeIndex is not completely thread-safe. This means that if one thread updates the index,
 * you must ensure that no other thread is reading or updating the index at the same time.
 *
 * @property options The index options.
 * @constructor Create a MutableS2ShapeIndex with the given options. Option values may be changed by calling Init().
 * @param options The options supplied for this index.

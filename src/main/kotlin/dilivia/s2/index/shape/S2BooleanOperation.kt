/**
 * This class implements boolean operations (intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference) for regions
 * whose boundaries are defined by geodesic edges.
 *
 * S2BooleanOperation operates on exactly two input regions at a time. Each region is represented as an S2ShapeIndex
 * and may contain any number of points, polylines, and polygons. The region is essentially the union of these objects,
 * except that polygon interiors must be disjoint from all other geometry (including other polygon interiors). If the
 * input geometry for a region does not meet this condition, it can be normalized by computing its union first.
 * Note that points or polylines are allowed to coincide with the boundaries of polygons.
 *
 * Degeneracies are supported. A polygon loop or polyline may consist of a single edge from a vertex to itself, and
 * polygons may contain "sibling pairs" consisting of an edge and its corresponding reverse edge. Polygons must not have
 * any duplicate edges (due to the requirement that polygon interiors are disjoint), but polylines may have duplicate
 * edges or can even be self-intersecting.
 *
 * Points and polyline edges are treated as multisets: if the same point or polyline edge appears multiple times in the
 * input, it will appear multiple times in the output. For example, the union of a point with an identical point
 * consists of two points. This feature is useful for modeling large sets of points or polylines as a single region
 * while maintaining their distinct identities, even when the points or polylines intersect each other. It is also
 * useful for reconstructing polylines that loop back on themselves. If duplicate geometry is not desired, it can be
 * merged by GraphOptions.DuplicateEdges.MERGE in the S2Builder output layer.
 *
 * Polylines are always considered to be directed. Polyline edges between the same pair of vertices are defined to
 * intersect even if the two edges are in opposite directions.  (Undirected polylines can be modeled by specifying
 * GraphOptions.EdgeType.UNDIRECTED in the S2Builder output layer.)
 *
 * The output of each operation is sent to an S2Builder.Layer provided by the client. This allows clients to build any
 * representation of the geometry they choose.  It also allows the client to do additional postprocessing of
 * the output before building data structures; for example, the client can easily discard degeneracies or convert them
 * to another data type. The boundaries of polygons and polylines can be modeled as open, semi-open, or closed.
 * Polyline boundaries are controlled by the PolylineModel class, whose options are as follows:
 *
 *  - In the OPEN model, polylines do not contain their first or last vertex except for one special case: namely, if
 *    the polyline forms a loop and the polyline_loops_have_boundaries() option is set to false, then the first/last
 *    vertex is contained.
 *
 *  - In the SEMI_OPEN model, polylines contain all vertices except the last. Therefore if one polyline starts where
 *    another polyline stops, the two polylines do not intersect.
 *
 *  - In the CLOSED model, polylines contain all of their vertices.
 *
 * When multiple polylines are present, they are processed independently and have no effect on each other. For example,
 * in the OPEN boundary model the polyline ABC contains the vertex B, while set of polylines {AB, BC} does not.
 * (If you want to treat the polylines as a union instead, with boundaries merged according to the "mod 2" rule,
 * this can be achieved by reassembling the edges into maximal polylines using S2PolylineVectorLayer with
 * EdgeType.UNDIRECTED, DuplicateEdges.MERGE, and PolylineType.WALK.)
 *
 * Polygon boundaries are controlled by the PolygonModel class, which has the following options:
 *
 *  - In the OPEN model, polygons do not contain their vertices or edges. This implies that a polyline that follows the
 *    boundary of a polygon will not intersect it.
 *
 *  - In the SEMI_OPEN model, polygon point containment is defined such that if several polygons tile the region around
 *    a vertex, then exactly one of those polygons contains that vertex.  Similarly polygons contain all of their edges,
 *    but none of their reversed edges.  This implies that a polyline and polygon edge with the same endpoints
 *    intersect if and only if they are in the same direction.  (This rule ensures that if a polyline is intersected
 *    with a polygon and its complement, the two resulting polylines do not have any edges in common.)
 *
 *  - In the CLOSED model, polygons contain all their vertices, edges, and reversed edges.  This implies that a
 *    polyline that shares an edge (in either direction) with a polygon is defined to intersect it.  Similarly, this
 *    is the only model where polygons that touch at a vertex or along an edge intersect.
 *
 * Note that PolylineModel and PolygonModel are defined as separate classes in order to allow for possible future
 * extensions.
 *
 * Operations between geometry of different dimensions are defined as follows:
 *
 *  - For UNION, the higher-dimensional shape always wins.  For example the union of a closed polygon A with a polyline
 *    B that coincides with the boundary of A consists only of the polygon A.
 *
 *  - For INTERSECTION, the lower-dimensional shape always wins.  For example, the intersection of a closed polygon A
 *    with a point B that coincides with a vertex of A consists only of the point B.
 *
 *  - For DIFFERENCE, higher-dimensional shapes are not affected by subtracting lower-dimensional shapes. For example,
 *    subtracting a point or polyline from a polygon A yields the original polygon A. This rule exists because in
 *    general, it is impossible to represent the output using the specified boundary model(s). (Consider subtracting
 *    one vertex from a PolylineModel.CLOSED polyline, or subtracting one edge from a PolygonModel.CLOSED polygon.)
 *    If you want to perform operations like this, consider representing all boundaries explicitly (topological
 *    boundaries) using OPEN boundary models.  Another option for polygons is to subtract a degenerate loop, which
 *    yields a polygon with a degenerate hole (see S2LaxPolygonShape).
 *
 * Note that in the case of Precision::EXACT operations, the above remarks only apply to the output before snapping.
 * Snapping may cause nearby distinct edges to become coincident, e.g. a polyline may become coincident with a polygon
 * boundary.  However also note that S2BooleanOperation is perfectly happy to accept such geometry as input.
 *
 * Note the following differences between S2BooleanOperation and the similar S2MultiBooleanOperation class:
 *
 *  - S2BooleanOperation operates on exactly two regions at a time, whereas S2MultiBooleanOperation operates on any
 *    number of regions.
 *
 *  - S2BooleanOperation is potentially much faster when the input is already represented as S2ShapeIndexes.
 *    The algorithm is output sensitive and is often sublinear in the input size.  This can be a big advantage if, say,
 *
 *  - S2BooleanOperation supports exact predicates and the corresponding exact operations (i.e., operations that are
 *    equivalent to computing the exact result and then snap rounding it).
 *
 *  - S2MultiBooleanOperation has better error guarantees when there are many regions, since it requires only one
 *    snapping operation for any number of input regions.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *   val a = S2ShapeIndex()
 *   val b = S2ShapeIndex()     // Input geometry, e.g. containing polygons.
 *   val polygon = S2Polygon()  // Output geometry.
 *   val options = S2BooleanOperation.Options()
 *   options.snapFunction = snapFunction
 *   val op = S2BooleanOperation(OpType.INTERSECTION, S2PolygonLayer(polygon), options)
 *   val error = S2Error()
 *   if (!op.build(a, b, error)) {
 *     logger.error { "Error: $error" }
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * If the output includes objects of different dimensions, they can be assembled into different layers with code like
 * this:
 *
 *   val points = mutableListOf<S2Point>()
 *   val polylines = S2Polyline()
 *   val polygon = S2Polygon()
 *   val op = S2BooleanOperation(
 *       OpType.UNION,
 *       PointVectorLayer(points),
 *       S2PolylineVectorLayer(polylines),
 *       S2PolygonLayer(polygon))

//
// Boolean operations are implemented by constructing the boundary of the
// result and then using S2Builder to assemble the edges.  The boundary is
// obtained by clipping each of the two input regions to the interior or
// exterior of the other region.  For example, to compute the union of A and
// B, we clip the boundary of A to the exterior of B and the boundary of B to
// the exterior of A; the resulting set of edges defines the union of the two
// regions.
//
// We use exact predicates, but inexact constructions (e.g. computing the
// intersection point of two edges).  Nevertheless, the following algorithm is
// guaranteed to be 100% robust, in that the computed boundary stays within a
// small tolerance (snap_radius + S2::kIntersectionError) of the exact
// result, and also preserves the correct topology (i.e., no crossing edges).
//
// Unfortunately this robustness cannot quite be achieved using the strategy
// outlined above (clipping the two input regions and assembling the
// resulting edges).  Since computed intersection points are not exact, the
// input geometry passed to S2Builder might contain self-intersections, and
// these self-intersections cannot be eliminated reliably by snap rounding.
//
// So instead, we pass S2Builder the entire set of input edges where at least
// some portion of each edge belongs to the output boundary.  We allow
// S2Builder to compute the intersection points and snap round the edges
// (which it does in a way that is guaranteed to preserve the input topology).
// Then once this is finished, we remove the portions of each edge that would
// have been clipped if we had done the clipping first.  This step only
// involves deciding whether to keep or discard each edge in the output, since
// all intersection points have already been resolved, and therefore there is
// no risk of creating new self-intersections.
//
// This is implemented using the following classes:
//
//  - S2BooleanOperation::Impl: the top-level class that clips each of
//                              the two regions to the other region.
//
//  - CrossingProcessor: a class that processes edge crossings and maintains
//                       the necessary state in order to clip the boundary
//                       of one region to the interior or exterior of the
//                       other region.
//
//  - EdgeClippingLayer: an S2Builder::Layer that removes graph edges that
//                       correspond to clipped portions of input edges, and
//                       passes the result to another layer for assembly.
//
//  - GraphEdgeClipper: a helper class that does the actual work of the
//                      EdgeClippingLayer.


// Given a set of clipping instructions encoded as a set of InputEdgeCrossings,
// GraphEdgeClipper determines which graph edges correspond to clipped
// portions of input edges and removes them.
//
// The clipping model is as follows.  The input consists of edge chains.  The
// clipper maintains an "inside" boolean state as it clips each chain, and
// toggles this state whenever an input edge is crossed.  Any edges that are
// deemed to be "outside" after clipping are removed.
//
// The "inside" state can be reset when necessary (e.g., when jumping to the
// start of a new chain) by adding a special crossing marked kSetInside.
// There are also two other special "crossings" that modify the clipping
// parameters: kSetInvertB specifies that edges should be clipped to the
// exterior of the other region, and kSetReverseA specifies that edges should
// be reversed before emitting them (which is needed to implement difference
// operations).
// "input_dimensions" is a vector specifying the dimension of each input
// edge (0, 1, or 2).  "input_crossings" is the set of all crossings to be
// used when clipping the edges of "g", sorted in lexicographic order.
//
// The clipped set of edges and their corresponding set of input edge ids
// are returned in "new_edges" and "new_input_edge_ids".  (These can be used
// to construct a new S2Builder::Graph.)

/**
 * S2ClosestEdgeQueryBase is a templatized class for finding the closest edge(s) between two geometries.  It is not
 * intended to be used directly, but rather to serve as the implementation of various specialized classes with more
 * convenient APIs (such as S2ClosestEdgeQuery).  It is flexible enough so that it can be adapted to compute maximum
 * distances and even potentially Hausdorff distances.
 *
 * By using the appropriate options, this class can answer questions such as:
 *
 *  - Find the minimum distance between two geometries A and B.
 *  - Find all edges of geometry A that are within a distance D of geometry B.
 *  - Find the k edges of geometry A that are closest to a given point P.
 *
 * You can also specify whether polygons should include their interiors (i.e., if a point is contained by a polygon,
 * should the distance be zero or should it be measured to the polygon boundary?)
 *
 * The input geometries may consist of any number of points, polylines, and polygons (collectively referred to as
 * "shapes").  Shapes do not need to be disjoint; they may overlap or intersect arbitrarily.  The implementation is
 * designed to be fast for both simple and complex geometries.
 *
 * The Distance template argument is used to represent distances. Usually it is a thin wrapper around S1ChordAngle,
 * but another distance type may be used as long as it implements the Distance concept described in S2DistanceTarget.
 * For example this can be used to measure maximum distances, to get more accuracy, or to measure
 * non-spheroidal distances.
 *
 * This class is a port of the S2ClosestEdgeQueryBase class of the Google S2 Geometry project (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).
 *
 * @param T The distance type.

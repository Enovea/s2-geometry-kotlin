/**
 * Utilities to compute "centroid" of a triangle.
 *
 * There are several notions of the "centroid" of a triangle.
 *  - First, there is the planar centroid, which is simply the centroid of the ordinary (non-spherical) triangle defined
 *    by the three vertices.
 *  - Second, there is the surface centroid, which is defined as the intersection of the three medians of the spherical
 *    triangle. It is possible to show that this point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
 *    sphere.
 *  - Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is defined as the surface integral over the spherical
 *    triangle of (x,y,z) divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would rotate around if it
 *    was spinning in empty space.
 *
 * The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the planar and surface centroids, the true centroid
 * behaves linearly as regions are added or subtracted. That is, if you split a triangle into pieces and compute the
 * average of their centroids (weighted by triangle area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle.
 * This is not true of the other centroids.
 *
 * Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive "center" of a spherical triangle.
 * For example, consider the triangle with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere). The surface
 * centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the
 * median from A (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since this is the shortest path
 * connecting the two endpoints. On the other hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto
 * the surface is a much more reasonable interpretation of the "center" of this triangle.
 *
 * This class is a port of the s2centroids methods of the Google S2 Geometry project (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).

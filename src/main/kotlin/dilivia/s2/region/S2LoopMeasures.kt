    //
    //  - Counter-clockwise loops are guaranteed to have positive area, and

    //    of sibling edge pairs) have an area of exactly zero.
    //
    //  - The full loop (containing all points, and represented as a loop with no
    //    vertices) has a negative area with the minimum possible magnitude.

        // main issues are (1) whether degenerate loops are considered to be CCW or
        // not (i.e., whether their area is close to 0 or 4*Pi), and (2) computing
        // the areas of small loops with good relative accuracy.
        //
        // With respect to degeneracies, we would like GetArea() to be consistent
        // with S2Loop::Contains(S2Point) in that loops that contain many points
        // should have large areas, and loops that contain few points should have
        // small areas.  For example, if a degenerate triangle is considered CCW
        // according to s2pred::Sign(), then it will contain very few points and
        // its area should be approximately zero.  On the other hand if it is
        // considered clockwise, then it will contain virtually all points and so
        // its area should be approximately 4*Pi.
        //
        // More precisely, let U be the set of S2Points for which S2::IsUnitLength()
        // is true, let P(U) be the projection of those points onto the mathematical
        // unit sphere, and let V(P(U)) be the Voronoi diagram of the projected
        // points.  Then for every loop x, we would like GetArea() to approximately
        // equal the sum of the areas of the Voronoi regions of the points p for
        // which x.Contains(p) is true.
        //
        // The second issue is that we want to compute the area of small loops
        // accurately.  This requires having good relative precision rather than
        // good absolute precision.  For example, if the area of a loop is 1e-12 and
        // the error is 1e-15, then the area only has 3 digits of accuracy.  (For
        // reference, 1e-12 is about 40 square meters on the surface of the earth.)
        // We would like to have good relative accuracy even for small loops.
        //
        // To achieve these goals, we combine two different methods of computing the
        // area.  This first method is based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which says
        // that the area enclosed by the loop equals 2*Pi minus the total geodesic
        // curvature of the loop (i.e., the sum of the "turning angles" at all the
        // loop vertices).  The big advantage of this method is that as long as we
        // use s2pred::Sign() to compute the turning angle at each vertex, then
        // degeneracies are always handled correctly.  In other words, if a
        // degenerate loop is CCW according to the symbolic perturbations used by
        // s2pred::Sign(), then its turning angle will be approximately 2*Pi.
        //
        // The disadvantage of the Gauss-Bonnet method is that its absolute error is
        // about 2e-15 times the number of vertices (see GetCurvatureMaxError).
        // So, it cannot compute the area of small loops accurately.
        //
        // The second method is based on splitting the loop into triangles and
        // summing the area of each triangle.  To avoid the difficulty and expense
        // of decomposing the loop into a union of non-overlapping triangles,
        // instead we compute a signed sum over triangles that may overlap (see the
        // comments for S2Loop::GetSurfaceIntegral).  The advantage of this method
        // is that the area of each triangle can be computed with much better
        // relative accuracy (using l'Huilier's theorem).  The disadvantage is that
        // the result is a signed area: CCW loops may yield a small positive value,
        // while CW loops may yield a small negative value (which is converted to a
        // positive area by adding 4*Pi).  This means that small errors in computing
        // the signed area may translate into a very large error in the result (if
        // the sign of the sum is incorrect).
        //
        // So, our strategy is to combine these two methods as follows.  First we
        // compute the area using the "signed sum over triangles" approach (since it
        // is generally more accurate).  We also estimate the maximum error in this
        // result.  If the signed area is too close to zero (i.e., zero is within
        // the error bounds), then we double-check the sign of the result using the
        // Gauss-Bonnet method.  If the two methods disagree, we return the smallest
        // possible positive or negative area based on the result of GetCurvature().
        // Otherwise we return the area that we computed originally.

    //    the loop exterior has been returned, and the integral over the loop
    //    interior can be obtained by adding the integral of f over the entire
    //    unit sphere (a constant) to the result.

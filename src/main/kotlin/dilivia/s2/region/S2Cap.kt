/**
 * S2Cap represents a disc-shaped region defined by a center and radius. Technically this shape is called a
 * "spherical cap" (rather than disc) because it is not planar; the cap represents a portion of the sphere that has
 * been cut off by a plane.  The boundary of the cap is the circle defined by the intersection of the sphere and the
 * plane. For containment purposes, the cap is a closed set, i.e. it contains its boundary.
 *
 * For the most part, you can use a spherical cap wherever you would use a disc in planar geometry.  The radius of the
 * cap is measured along the surface of the sphere (rather than the straight-line distance through the interior).
 * Thus a cap of radius Pi/2 is a hemisphere, and a cap of radius Pi covers the entire sphere.
 *
 * A cap can also be defined by its center point and height. The height is simply the distance from the center point
 * to the cutoff plane. There is also support for empty and full caps, which contain no points and all points
 * respectively.
 *
 * Here are some useful relationships between the cap height (h), the cap opening angle (theta), the maximum chord
 * length from the cap's center (d), and the radius of cap's base (a). All formulas assume a unit radius.
 *
 * h = 1 - cos(theta) = 2 sin^2(theta/2) d^2 = 2 h = a^2 + h^2
 *
 * This class is a port of the S2Cap class of the Google S2 Geometry project (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).
 *
 * @property center The center of the cap (a point on the unit sphere).
 * @property radius The radius of the cap given as a chord of the sphere.
 * @constructor Constructs a cap where the angle is expressed as an S1ChordAngle.  This constructor is more efficient
 * than the one with S1Angle.
 * @param center The center of the cap.
 * @param radius The radius of the cap.
 *

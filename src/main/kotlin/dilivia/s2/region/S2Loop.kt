/**
 * An S2Loop represents a simple spherical polygon. It consists of a single chain of vertices where the first vertex is
 * implicitly connected to the last. All loops are defined to have a CCW orientation, i.e. the interior of the loop is
 * on the left side of the edges. This implies that a clockwise loop enclosing a small area is interpreted to be a CCW
 * loop enclosing a very large area.
 *
 * Loops are not allowed to have any duplicate vertices (whether adjacent or not). Non-adjacent edges are not allowed
 * to intersect, and furthermore edges of length 180 degrees are not allowed (i.e., adjacent vertices cannot be
 * antipodal).  Loops must have at least 3 vertices (except for the empty and full loops discussed below).
 * Although these restrictions are not enforced in optimized code, you may get unexpected results if they are violated.
 *
 * There are two special loops: the "empty loop" contains no points, while the "full loop" contains all points.
 * These loops do not have any edges, but to preserve the invariant that every loop can be represented as a vertex
 * chain, they are defined as having exactly one vertex each (see kEmpty and kFull).
 *
 * Point containment of loops is defined such that if the sphere is subdivided into faces (loops), every point is
 * contained by exactly one face. This implies that loops do not necessarily contain their vertices.
 *
 * Note: The reason that duplicate vertices and intersecting edges are not allowed is that they make it harder to
 * define and implement loop relationships, e.g. whether one loop contains another.  If your data does not satisfy
 * these restrictions, you can use S2Builder to normalize it.
 *
 * This class is a port of the S2Loop class of the Google S2 Geometry project (https://github.com/google/s2geometry).

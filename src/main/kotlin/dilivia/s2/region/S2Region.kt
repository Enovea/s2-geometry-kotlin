 * A S2Region represents a two-dimensional region over the unit sphere. It is an abstract interface with various
 * concrete subtypes.
 *
 * The main purpose of this interface is to allow complex regions to be approximated as simpler regions. So rather than
 * having a wide variety of virtual methods that are implemented by all subtypes, the interface is restricted to
 * methods that are useful for computing approximations.

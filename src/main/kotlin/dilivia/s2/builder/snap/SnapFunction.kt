// A SnapFunction restricts the locations of the output vertices.  For
// example, there are predefined snap functions that require vertices to be
// located at S2CellId centers or at E5/E6/E7 coordinates.  The SnapFunction
// can also specify a minimum spacing between vertices (the "snap radius").
//
// A SnapFunction defines the following methods:
//
// 1. The SnapPoint() method, which snaps a point P to a nearby point (the
//    "candidate snap site").  Any point may be returned, including P
//    itself (this is the "identity snap function").
//
// 2. "snap_radius", the maximum distance that vertices can move when
//    snapped.  The snap_radius must be at least as large as the maximum
//    distance between P and SnapPoint(P) for any point P.
//
// 3. "max_edge_deviation", the maximum distance that edges can move when
//    snapped.  It is slightly larger than "snap_radius" because when a
//    geodesic edge is snapped, the center of the edge moves further than
//    its endpoints.  This value is computed automatically by S2Builder.
//
// 4. "min_vertex_separation", the guaranteed minimum distance between
//    vertices in the output.  This is generally a fraction of
//    "snap_radius" where the fraction depends on the snap function.
//
// 5. A "min_edge_vertex_separation", the guaranteed minimum distance
//    between edges and non-incident vertices in the output.  This is
//    generally a fraction of "snap_radius" where the fraction depends on
//    the snap function.
//
// It is important to note that SnapPoint() does not define the actual
// mapping from input vertices to output vertices, since the points it
// returns (the candidate snap sites) are further filtered to ensure that
// they are separated by at least the snap radius.  For example, if you
// specify E7 coordinates (2cm resolution) and a snap radius of 10m, then a
// subset of points returned by SnapPoint will be chosen (the "snap sites"),
// and each input vertex will be mapped to the closest site.  Therefore you
// cannot assume that P is necessarily snapped to SnapPoint(P).
//
// S2Builder makes the following guarantees:
//
// 1. Every vertex is at a location returned by SnapPoint().
//
// 2. Vertices are within "snap_radius" of the corresponding input vertex.
//
// 3. Edges are within "max_edge_deviation" of the corresponding input edge
//    (a distance slightly larger than "snap_radius").
//
// 4. Vertices are separated by at least "min_vertex_separation"
//    (a fraction of "snap_radius" that depends on the snap function).
//
// 5. Edges and non-incident vertices are separated by at least
//    "min_edge_vertex_separation" (a fraction of "snap_radius").
//
// 6. Vertex and edge locations do not change unless one of the conditions
//    above is not already met (idempotency / stability).
//
// 7. The topology of the input geometry is preserved (up to the creation
//    of degeneracies).  This means that there exists a continuous
//    deformation from the input to the output such that no vertex
//    crosses an edge.

        // move by at most a distance R, the center of the edge moves by at most
        // asin(sin(R) / cos(L / 2)).  Thus the (max_edge_deviation / snap_radius)
        // ratio increases with both the snap radius R and the edge length L.

        // snap radii, edges up to 49 degrees long are never split.  (Edges of any
        // length are not split unless their endpoints move far enough so that the
        // actual edge deviation exceeds the limit; in practice, splitting is rare

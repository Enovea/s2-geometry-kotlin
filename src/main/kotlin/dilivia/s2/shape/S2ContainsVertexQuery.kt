// This class determines whether a polygon contains one of its vertices given
// the edges incident to that vertex.  The result is +1 if the vertex is
// contained, -1 if it is not contained, and 0 if the incident edges consist
// of matched sibling pairs (in which case the result cannot be determined
// locally).
//
// Point containment is defined according to the "semi-open" boundary model
// (see S2VertexModel), which means that if several polygons tile the region
// around a vertex, then exactly one of those polygons contains that vertex.
//
// This class is not thread-safe.  To use it in parallel, each thread should
// construct its own instance (this is not expensive).
// "target" is the vertex whose containment will be determined.

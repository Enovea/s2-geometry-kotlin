// The purpose of S2Shape is to represent polygonal geometry in a flexible
// way.  It is organized as a collection of edges that optionally defines an
// interior.  All geometry represented by an S2Shape must have the same
// dimension, which means that an S2Shape can represent either a set of
// points, a set of polylines, or a set of polygons.
//
// S2Shape is defined as an abstract base class in order to give clients
// control over the underlying data representation.  Sometimes an S2Shape does
// not have any data of its own, but instead "wraps" some other class.  There
// are various useful subtypes defined in *_shape.h, and some S2 classes also
// have a nested "Shape" class (e.g., S2Polygon::Shape).  It is easy for
// clients to implement their own subtypes, since the interface is minimal.
//
// S2Shape operations are typically defined on S2ShapeIndex objects rather
// than individual shapes.  An S2ShapeIndex is simply a collection of
// S2Shapes, possibly of different dimensions (e.g. 10 points and 3 polygons),
// organized into a data structure for efficient edge access.
//
// The edges of an S2Shape are identified by a contiguous range of "edge ids"
// starting at 0.  The edges are further subdivided into "chains", where each
// chain consists of a sequence of edges connected end-to-end (a polyline).
// For example, an S2Shape representing two polylines AB and CDE would have
// three edges (AB, CD, DE) grouped into two chains: (AB) and (CD, DE).
// Similarly, an S2Shape representing 5 points would have 5 chains consisting
// of one edge each.
//
// S2Shape has methods that allow edges to be accessed either using the global
// numbering (edge id) or within a particular chain.  The global numbering is
// sufficient for most purposes, but the chain representation is useful for
// certain algorithms such as intersection (see S2BooleanOperation).

    //      interior is always on the left.  In theory the edges may be returned
    //      in any order, but typically the edges are organized as a collection
    //      of edge chains where each chain represents one polygon loop.
    //      Polygons may have degeneracies (e.g., degenerate edges or sibling
    //      pairs consisting of an edge and its corresponding reversed edge).

    // Because this method exists in all S2Shapes, you can override it in each
    // type of shape you have and call it without knowing the concrete subtype.
    // For example, if you have polyline and polygon shapes, you can do this:

    //
    //  - Every shape has an id() assigned by S2ShapeIndex.  Ids are assigned
    //    sequentially starting from 0 in the order the shapes are added to the
    //    index.  You can use this id to look up arbitrary data stored in your
    //    own vector.
    //
    //  - If all of your shapes are the same type, then you can create your own
    //    subclass of some existing S2Shape type (such as S2Polyline::Shape) and
    //    add your own methods and fields.  You can access this data by

// Given a set of shapes, InteriorTracker keeps track of which shapes contain
// a particular point (the "focus").  It provides an efficient way to move the
// focus from one point to another and incrementally update the set of shapes
// which contain it.  We use this to compute which shapes contain the center
// of every S2CellId in the index, by advancing the focus from one cell center
// to the next.
//
// Initially the focus is at the start of the S2CellId space-filling curve.
// We then visit all the cells that are being added to the MutableS2ShapeIndex
// in increasing order of S2CellId.  For each cell, we draw two edges: one
// from the entry vertex to the center, and another from the center to the
// exit vertex (where "entry" and "exit" refer to the points where the
// space-filling curve enters and exits the cell).  By counting edge crossings
// we can incrementally compute which shapes contain the cell center.  Note
// that the same set of shapes will always contain the exit point of one cell
// and the entry point of the next cell in the index, because either (a) these
// two points are actually the same, or (b) the intervening cells in S2CellId
// order are all empty, and therefore there are no edge crossings if we follow
// this path from one cell to the other.

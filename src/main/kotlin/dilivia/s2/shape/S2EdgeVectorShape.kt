// S2EdgeVectorShape is an S2Shape representing an arbitrary set of edges.  It
// is mainly used for testing, but it can also be useful if you have, say, a
// collection of polylines and don't care about memory efficiency (since this
// class would store most of the vertices twice).
//
// Note that if you already have data stored in an S2Loop, S2Polyline, or
// S2Polygon, then you would be better off using the "Shape" class defined
// within those classes (e.g., S2Loop::Shape).  Similarly, if the vertex data
// is stored in your own data structures, you can easily write your own
// subclass of S2Shape that points to the existing vertex data rather than
// copying it.

  constructor(a: S2Point, b: S2Point): this(edges = listOf(Edge(a, b)))

  // removing them from the index, making changes, and adding them back again.
